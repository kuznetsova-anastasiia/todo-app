This is a simple web application for managing a to-do list.

## Description

The Todo List App is a dynamic web application built using React, SCSS, Material UI and TypeScript. It allows users to create new tasks, mark them as completed, delete them from the list and change their titles.

The application uses API to store the tasks, so the user's data will persist even if they close and reopen the browser.

The design of the application is minimalistic and user-friendly, with a simple layout and clear visual cues for completed and active tasks.
